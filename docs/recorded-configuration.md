# Inspect the model and Hermes configuration

![Selected installed Hermes configuration](images/configuration.jpg)

The image shows selected fields from the installed `commitments` profile. It is a configuration reference rendered from actual saved settings, not a Hermes application screen. The [source record](../evidence/configuration-view.json) includes the capture time and SHA-256 of the source profile. Credentials, tool environments and local paths are excluded. The profile was captured after the runs, so it does not independently prove the exact configuration of an earlier run.

Create an isolated profile with the repository setup command, then inspect its model endpoint and MCP tool paths before starting the gateway or scheduler. Setup templates and the installed profile can differ. A service using an existing profile must reload after its configuration changes.

The model alias alone does not establish the GGUF, runtime build or effective sampling values. Use the launch guide and recorded HTTP requests to check those separately. No matched optimization or cost reduction is established by this screenshot.
